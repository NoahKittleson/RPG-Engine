>If it's worth doing, it's worth doing badly.  That's the principle that I'm working off of.

>Bear with me.
>Thirty years ago, there was a man by the name of Aethriz.  He lived close to here, and he was young and brave and very handsome.  You know the type.
>He met a woman named Josephine.  She was also quite beautiful, if I can say so myself, and she had the willpower of an arrow in flight.  Once she was set on her path, nothing could stop her.
>They were inseparable.  They ate together, they worked the fields together, they slept toge-  Well.  I'll skip over that for now.
>They were happy, and they didn't have much else, but they didn't need much else.
>One day the army came.
>There was a rebellion to the east.  They said they needed to use this area to stage their offensive.


>He met a woman named Josephine.  She was also quite beautiful, if I can say so myself, but she was more well known for her willpower.  She was like the sunrise, consistent and unstoppable.
>It's easy enough to say that they loved each other.  It's much more difficult to have those words truly mean what they should.  It seems each story begins with love as a something presumed or inferred.  And this one is no different.
>Just know that they loved each other very much, and take that for whatever you will.
>In any case, they lived on a farm just north of here.
>...
>Twenty years ago, the rebellions started in the East.
>The army came and started setting up bases.  Started taking food and supplies.
>Twenty years later and things haven't changed.  It's only become more and more normal.
>They may come and go, moving bases of operations forward and back.
>But they'll always be back.  At least that's how it feels.
>...
>Aethriz and Josephine tried to mind their own business.  It didn't matter.
>All good things must come to an end sometime.
>Aethriz was drafted.  He protested but it didn't matter.
>Three months into his service he tried to flee from his squadron.  He was caught and executed for desertion.



>Rosalind, do you want anything from in town?
>...
>Rosalind, I'm going into town. Is there anything you-
>Mom, I can hear you. I just don't want anything.

>Oh my word.  That shawl.  That hat.  An exquisite look.  A marvelous look.  I think this is truly the essence of style.  No, not that.  Too bland, too unspecific.  Yes, that's it, I love this style precisely because it IS specific.  I simply can't explain it any other way.
>Well thank you.
>No no no, I understand your apology, I understand that you only wish to express gratitude for the kinds words I have given, and it's not that I find them unnecessary or insincere, it's that I don't want them.  I want you to be bold.  I want you to know and not care about my words, or better yet, to NOT know and NOT care.  Am I clear?
>No.
>Ha! Excellent!


>The first thing you must do is dissuade yourself of the notion that we can, should, or do live in the best possible world.
>Before we move on, we must agree on this sacred principle.
>Do you agree?
*(1)Yes *(2)No
>(1)Very well.  Then only one step remains.
>Take that notion, and revel in it.  Drown in it.
>Do not make the actions that you think are better or worse.  Do not tell others only what they want to hear.  There are no better or worse outcomes.  Only outcomes that you take, and others that you don't.
>Reality does not exist to test you on your choices.  Let it exist as a canvas on which you paint yourself through your actions.
>Only through choosing that YOU would choose will you accomplish this.
>Now.  Let us begin.
>(2)I see. On which count do you take umbrage with?
*(3)That we DO live the best possible world *(4)That we SHOULD live the best possible world *(5)That we CAN live the best possible world
>(3)You truly think that we live in the best possible world?  That things couldn't possibly be better?
>In some way I envy your optimism and innocence.  In most ways I do not.
>Furthermore, do you believe that each decision you have made is for the best? That each decision you make will always be for the best?
>Why make any decisions at all?  Why try at anything?  We will be in the best possible world regardless.
>If you truly believe this then I see no need for you to play this game.
>Play it or not, you will convince yourself regardless that you have chosen the best possible option.
>But perhaps that means you are the perfect candidate for this game.  You will never feel regret over your actions.  That is my true purpose for this game.  To free you from the weight of your consequences.  To narrow down your worldview so that there are no right and wrong paths.  Just paths that you will take, and paths that you won't take.
>The choice to play, ultimately, is yours.
>(4)Fair enough.  But do not mistake my meaning.  I wholeheartedly believe that we should strive towards creating the best possible world.
>But I do not believe it to be an attainable goal.
>The argument of whether or not we should live in an impossibly perfect world seems irrelevant to me.
>I will concede this.
>But know this: Along your path to create the most perfect world you can, you will assuredly make choices with unintended consequences.
>I implore you only to do this: Do not regret your actions.  Do not live in the past.  Only move forward.
>That is all you can do.
>(5)My my, what the optimist we have here.
>I almost wish not to dissuade you.
>Almost.
>But we must live in the reality of our circumstances, not the reality of our choosing.
>To be clear, I do not wish to stop you from trying to steer the world toward it's best possible outcome.  I encourage you.
>What I do not wish to see is feelings of regret or failure when this is not the case.  To experience this is part of what it means to be human.
>Try not to live in the future or the past.  Live only in the here and now.  Do not plan, do not strategize.  Accept what has happened, and feel what you must do.
