-If it's worth doing, it's worth doing badly.  That's the principle that I'm working off of.

-Bear with me.
-Thirty years ago, there was a man by the name of Aethriz.  He lived close to here, and he was young and brave and very handsome.  You know the type.
-He met a woman named Josephine.  She was also quite beautiful, if I can say so myself, and she had the willpower of an arrow in flight.  Once she was set on her path, nothing could stop her.
-They were inseparable.  They ate together, they worked the fields together, they slept toge-  Well.  I'll skip over that for now.
-They were happy, and they didn't have much else, but they didn't need much else.
-One day the army came.
-There was a rebellion to the east.  They said they needed to use this area to stage their offensive.


-He met a woman named Josephine.  She was also quite beautiful, if I can say so myself, but she was more well known for her willpower.  She was like the sunrise, consistent and unstoppable.
-It's easy enough to say that they loved each other.  It's much more difficult to have those words truly mean what they should.  It seems each story begins with love as a something presumed or inferred.  And this one is no different.
-Just know that they loved each other very much, and take that for whatever you will.
-In any case, they lived on a farm just north of here.
-...
-Twenty years ago, the rebellions started in the East.
-The army came and started setting up bases.  Started taking food and supplies.
-Twenty years later and things haven't changed.  It's only become more and more normal.
-They may come and go, moving bases of operations forward and back.
-But they'll always be back.  At least that's how it feels.
-...
-Aethriz and Josephine tried to mind their own business.  It didn't matter.
-All good things must come to an end sometime.
-Aethriz was drafted.  He protested but it didn't matter.
-Three months into his service he tried to flee from his squadron.  He was caught and executed for desertion.
