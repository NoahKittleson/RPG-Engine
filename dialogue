#1 //conversation with daughter
>If it's worth doing, it's worth doing badly.  That's the principle that I'm working off of.

# //opening cutscene
>Bear with me.
>Thirty years ago, there was a man by the name of Aethriz.  He lived close to here, and he was young and brave and very handsome.  You know the type.
>He met a woman named Josephine.  She was also quite beautiful, if I can say so myself, and she had the willpower of an arrow in flight.  Once she was set on her path, nothing could stop her.
>They were inseparable.  They ate together, they worked the fields together, they slept toge-  Well.  I'll skip over that for now.
>They were happy, and they didn't have much else, but they didn't need much else.
>One day the army came.
>There was a rebellion to the east.  They said they needed to use this area to stage their offensive.


>He met a woman named Josephine.  She was also quite beautiful, if I can say so myself, but she was more well known for her willpower.  She was like the sunrise, consistent and unstoppable.
>It's easy enough to say that they loved each other.  It's much more difficult to have those words truly mean what they should.  It seems each story begins with love as a something presumed or inferred.  And this one is no different.
>Just know that they loved each other very much, and take that for whatever you will.
>In any case, they lived on a farm just north of here.
>...
>Twenty years ago, the rebellions started in the East.
>The army came and started setting up bases.  Started taking food and supplies.
>Twenty years later and things haven't changed.  It's only become more and more normal.
>They may come and go, moving bases of operations forward and back.
>But they'll always be back.  At least that's how it feels.
>...
>Aethriz and Josephine tried to mind their own business.  It didn't matter.
>All good things must come to an end sometime.
>Aethriz was drafted.  He protested but it didn't matter.
>Three months into his service he tried to flee from his squadron.  He was caught and executed for desertion.



>Rosalind, do you want anything from in town?
>...
>Rosalind, I'm going into town. Is there anything you-
>Mom, I can hear you. I just don't want anything.

>Oh my word.  That shawl.  That hat.  An exquisite look.  A marvelous look.  I think this is truly the essence of style.  No, not that.  Too bland, too unspecific.  Yes, that's it, I love this style precisely because it IS specific.  I simply can't explain it any other way.
>Well thank you.
>No no no, I understand your apology, I understand that you only wish to express gratitude for the kinds words I have given, and it's not that I find them unnecessary or insincere, it's that I don't want them.  I want you to be bold.  I want you to know and not care about my words, or better yet, to NOT know and NOT care.  Am I clear?
>No.
>Ha! Excellent!


>The first thing you must do is dissuade yourself of the notion that we can, should, or do live in the best possible world.
>Before we move on, we must agree on this sacred principle.
>Do you agree?
*(1)Yes *(2)No
>(1)Very well.  Then only one step remains.
>Take that notion, and revel in it.  Drown in it.
>Do not make the actions that you think are better or worse.  Do not tell others only what they want to hear.  There are no better or worse outcomes.  Only outcomes that you take, and others that you don't.
>Reality does not exist to test you on your choices.  Let it exist as a canvas on which you paint yourself through your actions.
>Only through choosing that YOU would choose will you accomplish this.
>Now.  Let us begin.
>(2)I see. On which count do you take umbrage with?
*(3)That we DO live the best possible world *(4)That we SHOULD live the best possible world *(5)That we CAN live the best possible world
>(3)You truly think that we live in the best possible world?  That things couldn't possibly be better?
>In some way I envy your optimism and innocence.  In most ways I do not.
>Furthermore, do you believe that each decision you have made is for the best? That each decision you make will always be for the best?
>Why make any decisions at all?  Why try at anything?  We will be in the best possible world regardless.
>If you truly believe this then I see no need for you to play this game.
>Play it or not, you will convince yourself regardless that you have chosen the best possible option.
>But perhaps that means you are the perfect candidate for this game.  You will never feel regret over your actions.  That is my true purpose for this game.  To free you from the weight of your consequences.  To narrow down your worldview so that there are no right and wrong paths.  Just paths that you will take, and paths that you won't take.
>The choice to play, ultimately, is yours.
>(4)Fair enough.  But do not mistake my meaning.  I wholeheartedly believe that we should strive towards creating the best possible world.
>But I do not believe it to be an attainable goal.
>The argument of whether or not we should live in an impossibly perfect world seems irrelevant to me.
>I will concede this.
>But know this: Along your path to create the most perfect world you can, you will assuredly make choices with unintended consequences.
>I implore you only to do this: Do not regret your actions.  Do not live in the past.  Only move forward.
>That is all you can do.
>(5)My my, what the optimist we have here.
>I almost wish not to dissuade you.
>Almost.
>But we must live in the reality of our circumstances, not the reality of our choosing.
>To be clear, I do not wish to stop you from trying to steer the world toward it's best possible outcome.  I encourage you.
>What I do not wish to see is feelings of regret or failure when this is not the case.  To experience this is part of what it means to be human.
>Try not to live in the future or the past.  Live only in the here and now.  Do not plan, do not strategize.  Accept what has happened, and feel what you must do.


>We make decisions for one of three reasons: the present, or the future.
>Only when we act in our present do we most resemble our true selves.  But very rarely do we act this way.
>In our day to day, we almost exclusively act for our future.  To act for the present is considered selfish.
>But consider this: if you knew the world was ending tomorrow, what would you do?
>You would certainly do something, and that something would almost certainly not be what you would normally do.  Correct?
>But that is because you would be forced to live in the present.  Completely and wholly, with absolutely no regard for the future.
>Strangely freeing, no?
>Yet also, this shows that there is a side of ourselves that we never see.  Decisions that we never allow ourselves to make.
>For are we not defined by our decisions?
>So here is my quest for you.  Find that other self.  The present self.  And let them take control.
>Perhaps you will find the experience freeing.  Or thrilling.  Or perhaps not.
>But either way, this is the perfect environment to test out that other self, is it not?

>Hey lady, I have a question for you.
>You ever eaten horse before?
*(1)Yes *(2)No *(3)Ew
>(1)Wow, nice! How was it?
*(4)Delicious *(5)Disgusting
>(4)Aw man!  Now I gotta try it!
>I've never had horse before, but I've always wanted to.  Don't know why.  That's just the way it is.
>Whenever I tell people, they think I'm weird.  I'm glad you understand though.
>(5)Damn.  That's too bad.
>But I have to say, I've made up my mind and I'm going to stick with it.  I have to at least try it at some point.
>Thanks for your honest opinion though.
>(2)Yeah, me neither.  But I want to, real bad!  Listen, if you ever find horse meat, can you let me know?
>(3)Yeah honestly, I get that a lot.
>Listen, I don't expect you to understand, but I just really want to try horse meat.  Frankly I don't really know why either.
>It's just something I have to do.
>Maybe you should think about it too, you know?  Keep an open mind!


[102]
>Hey remember what I said last time? About the horses?
>Part of the reason it's so hard is because they're so expensive.  Every horse within at least fifty miles has been commandeered by the army.  It's at least a thousand coin, and that's if you can even find a vendor!  The only people that'll sell are black market.
>But I've got a plan. I may not look like it, but I'm a pretty good baker.
>One loaf of bread sells for 1 gold.  All I have to do is do that one thousand times! That'd can't be that hard, right?
>I'll just bake my bread at home and bring it here and sell it.  Pretty smart huh?  I don't even need an establishment.
>Hey, when I set up my shop, will you come by and buy some bread?
*(1)Yes *(2)No
>(1)Thanks!  I'll make sure to save you my best loaf.
>(2)Ha! Honestly, I just love the honesty.  See ya around!

#Clara
>Hey Isabel.  It's been a long time.
>How is life going at the farm?
#Isabel
>There's nothing there for me anymore.  I can't take care of the crops anymore and they died.
#Clara
>So what, you just leave?  Isabel, you can't just abandon that place.  Where will you go?  What are you gonna do?
#Isabel
>I don't know.  But if I just stay there I'll die.
>Clara, I know you won't understand but I just feel like that place is my grave and I'm just waiting to die.
#Clara
>...
>Isabel, I know that feeling better than anyone.
>I feel it every day.  But not just about my house, about this whole village, and this whole country.  No matter where I go I feel that way.  There's nothing I can do.  One day I'll die and I feel like they'll just bury me wherever I am.
>That's just the way things are.
>Tell me Isabel.  What's the biggest fear you have about death?
*(1)The nothingness of death *(2)My regrets *(3)The act of dying
>(1)Not much of one for the afterlife? Me neither.  I envy everyone who believes in it, I really do.
>But no matter how hard, I just can't believe.
>I think the capacity for belief is like a muscle.  If you don't use it, it'll atrophy and die.  Mine passed a long time ago.
>......
>Take care, Isabel.  If you need a place to stay, you can stay with me.
>(2)Huh, that surprises me.  Sure, I got regrets of my own but you can bet I'll have bigger concerns when I'm looking death in the face.
>My past may not be pretty, but I'd live it all again and make the same mistakes if it meant that I got to keep on living.
>......
>Isabel, if you need anything just let me know.  And you can stay here for as long as you like.
>(3)Me too.  Why fear being dead?  You won't experience anything.  You won't do anything.  You won't be anything.
>But those moments when I know I'm dying, those scare me more than anything.
>Thinking about my whole life in those final moments.  Knowing that everything is about to come crashing to an end. I...
>I....
>Sorry Isabel, I don't feel much like talking anymore.
>You can stay here if you want.

#Isabel
>Hello.
#Malaga
>Uh, hi.  Is there something you want?
*(1)You look hurt *(2)No
>(1)Yeah.  I am.
>But you didn't answer my question.  What is it you want?
*(3)I don't want anything *(4)I want to help
>(3)Fine. Good.  Me too.  Looks like we can both go about our business then.

>(2)Good.  Cause I don't know if you can see but I'm not really in a position where I care about what other people want.
>(4)Wow.  Good for you.  I'm sure you're a model citizen.  Is that what you wanted to hear?  Is that what you thought I'd say.  You're just saying things you think I want to hear.
>Just go away.  I don't want your help.  You shouldn't want to help me.  The army wouldn't want you helping me.
*(5)I'm no friend of the army *(6)Just shut up and let me help you.
>(5)Oh?  I... Well... I have to say I didn't expect that.
>You just don't look the type, you know?  I definitely figured you for just some senile old lady who didn't care about the army coming in and ruining half the country.
>Okay.  You know what?  Fine.  If you really care then help me up and get me out of here.  My wounds will be fine, but what might really kill me is if I'm sitting here and the wrong person comes by.

//the same dialogue as above, but written with the idea that all decisions should be meaningful and explicit.  Also not being afraid to have Isabel speak on her own.

#Isabel
>Hello.
#Malaga
>Uh, hi.  Is there something you want?
#Isabel
>No. I just-
#Malaga
>Good.  Cause I don't know if you can see but I'm not really in a position where I care about what other people want.
#Isabel
>Girl.  Calm yourself down.  You need medical help.
#Malaga
>No.  Lady, you don't get it.  I don't want you here.  You shouldn't want to be here.  The army certainly doesn't want you to be here.
>If they knew you were helping me you'd be worse off then I am now.
*(3)Help her *(4)Stay on good side of Army
#Isabel
>(4)If that's the way you want it to be then fine.
>There's no helping some people.
>(3)That's too bad for the army then because you going to shut up and come with me.
#Malaga
>Okay.  You know what?  Fine.  If you really care then help me up and get me out of here.  My wounds will be fine, but what might really kill me is if I'm sitting here and the wrong person comes by.
