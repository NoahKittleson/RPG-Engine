//alright, let's start this off the same way that I start out every writing session, by just writing whatever comes to mind.  I don't have any real good ideas right now, so I'm just doing stream of consciousness and seeing how long it takes me.  So I've toyed with the idea before of just using things that have happened in my DND campaigns and just reappropriating them, but I am not too sure about it.  However I do like the idea of just stealing the characters and seeing where to go from there.  I mean, I don't want to include them just as -is but fuck let's just try it.


//as a fun little exercise, let's have a conversation between one of my characters and a character from a game that isn't my own.  Wow do I feel stupid for doing this, I hope it's actually helpful.
#Corkus
Hey, come on Snake,  we're heading out.
#Naked Snake
I'm ready.
#Corkus
Yeah, great.  Hey, can you carry this crate for me?
#Naked Snake
A crate?
#Corkus
Yeah sorry usually it's my job but I got a bad charlie horse last night.  I would ask Muhib or Grekel to do it, but honestly they'd just say no.
#Snake
>...hhmmm...
>Do you have a backpack or something I could put it all in?
#Corkus
>Well, no.  Not really.  I mean, 

Main tenets of the game (things that I am sure I want. They are prioritized over other ideas and hopefully will be the basis for the creation of idea offshoots)
#Story is highly adaptable.I don't mean this so much in the way that there is a main storyline that adapts with player choice, a la bioware, with good choices vs bad choices that effect the game, or even banner saga.  In these games, the direction of the narrative is constant, but how you get there is changed based on what you choose and what happens.  I want greater trajectory changes based on the choices chosen.  What that entails I'm not sure yet.
#The main character is an elderly woman
#The story is told from a frame narrative
#The story takes place in the country, which is currently close to the front of a rebellion.  The war is going to be a big part of what the story is about, but it's not a story about the war and the generals and the soldiers, it's a war about the civilians and how their lives change.  Think about Dead Dead Demons Dedededede Destruction, how it focuses on a group of people whose lives are changed by living so close to death.
#The main characters will not be able to change the course of this war, AT ALL.  They may try to, and they may change individual people, but this is not the tale of the WAR.  This is just one insignificant battle, and they cannot stop it from happening, they cannot force one side to win over the other.

From these tenets here are some ideas for spitballing.  I will intentionally write down some bad ideas just to get the creative juices flowing and in order to not be afraid to fail.
#The story is about a group of refugees who decide to stay behind as the battle approaches.  There is infighting, death, fear, desperation, and brutality.  Within this fear of being wiped out, fascism emerges.
#The elderly woman decides to stick around because she feels she is too old to get up and start anew.  Perhaps a weariness?
#Possible characters: A talking cat (who doesn't love this? Except Mona, because he's not really a cat), A soldier, A criminal child, An elderly man, A mother, An idealist, a communist/anarchist, a medic/doctor, a fisherman, an old vendor.
#Perhaps start the story out with some meaningless and unimportant task, such as fetching some supplies or ingredients from a nearby town.  That gives kind of a low-stakes way to introduce characters and also acclimate new players to how the game will work and how choices might matter.
#It could be useful to list out events that will ALWAYS happen. Or maybe just MILESTONE ACTIONS that will come to pass, or must be avoided through some series of events.  These events will be pivotal to the trajectory of the story.
-The battle, obvs.
-The destruction of a town.  Flooding?
-The death of party members, PCs.
-The prosperity of a party member, PCs.
-The exiting of the military, and their sudden re-entrance.
-The burning or chopping down of the forest.
-The construction of some machine of war outside of a town.
-A riot in the town
-An attack by some animal from the forest
-The curse of a cantankerous witch from the swamp.
-The visiting of a ship in the docks in town
-A festival on the beach.
-The closing of various stores as the fight draws closer.
-The sudden disappearance of one specific thing (in line with the witch curse)
-A season change
-A disease spreading through a town.  Or perhaps one character getting sick.

Here I want to list some major problems that get in the way of me actually sitting down to write, and a specific idea that will overcome (or at least help overcome) the problem.
#I don't really know a feasible way for the main character to meet the other characters
-Create circumstances in which it makes sense for the main character to be going around and speaking with strangers:
	-Looking for a specific person
	-Looking to buy a specific ingredient
	-Asking people for directions
	-Begging for money/food
-It should also be stated that some situations make it very obvious why you would want to talk to a person, such as:
	-The person is wounded
	-The person is otherwise unwell
	-The person starts talking with YOU for whatever reason.
	-The person clearly sticks out of a crowd (they're a soldier)
-While a REASON is nice to have a certain points, I don't think it's necessary in all places.  In fact, I like the freedom of not having a task looming over your head.  The simple act of just going around talking with people can be fun.

#I don't know if there's actually going to be combat in the game.
-Honestly, with the way things are looking right now it feels like combat just doesn't really fit into anything that I've written so far.  I don't know where it would be, and I don't know how it would fit in.  However, I still like the idea of having it in the game, so let's work under the assumption for now that:
-The game has combat, but it is very limited.  No random encounters.  No leveling.  All of it will be story focused, and it will be mostly basic.  It's the not the center of the game.  If it ends up being bad, take it out.
-OR, there is turn based combat, but it isn't actually COMBAT, per se.  Perhaps something cheeky, a la LISA?

#Perhaps the biggest barrier is that I don't know who the characters are going to be.  Especially who is going to be a party member, or an important NPC or what.  So...
-I think I should act under the assumption that every single character, outside of maybe some token few, are playable and recruitable depending on the path you go down.  Just think of how cool that would be.  So basically, start out assuming that they are a recruitable player, and then if it doesn't work out well, just make it not so.
-That being said, here are some ideas for possible characters (including those that I've already made sprites or dialogue for)
>thief girl
>the colonel
>minor soldiers/guards (loyal soldier, lazy/reluctant soldier, mean sold, nice sold, party sold)
>fisherman
>sailor
>refugee from elsewhere
>a talking animal (cat, owl, street dog, elk).  Multiple talking animals
>a spirit of some sort?
>a very old tree
>a monk
>a thug with a heart of hold
>the white knight from TtLG
>a sassy cobbler
>an eccentric mystic hunter
>some archaeologist engineers.
>irreverent/party musician.  Blacky from Underground.
>bartender Corkus with war/crime stories
Once again, just consider that everyone you talk to can be playable, so really anyone in the town can be a potential character.

>Idea: child will do something very big (like steal something and sabotage something), and unless you find their specific spot where they hide and do said thing, you won't be able to stop the outcome.
-I feel like I need more moments like these.

>Idea: just write up IDEAS for a lot of conversations, fill in the blanks later. Example: introduction to X character, talk about this, include this character's dissent, offer this choice.

>To what extent do I want to have secret conditions for people joining the party?  I think it will be hard to do without, but it brings with it some potential pitfalls...
>Writing these out I find myself particularly stymied by trying to think of a decision for every conversation, and putting that in writing it seems obvious to me that a decision for every conversation is not the right way to go.  Not every conversation should be long and not every conversation should end in a decision?  God I still don't know....


The guiding principles of the conversation decisions-
1. All decisions must be upfront about what they entail.  This is so players don't feel cheated or regret a decision they made, not realizing the results.
2. In order to keep decisions upfront in what they entail, there must be no meaningless or inconsequential decisions, as the players won't know if their decisions matter, and then the decisions are by definition not upfront.
3. The decisions have to be interesting.  They have to have some effect that the player will care about, and not be some generic good vs evil options.
