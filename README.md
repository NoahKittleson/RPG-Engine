##**Overview**
 This is the basis for a turn-based role playing game.  There is functionality in place for three different states: The Overworld, where the player can move around from screen to screen and interact with objects and people; the Battle mode, where the players's party fights an opposing party; and the Dialogue mode where the player can talk with some non-player entity through a dialogue tree.
